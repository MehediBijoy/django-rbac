# Project Setup Guide

## Create Virtual Environment

Start by creating a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a virtual environment named `venv`.

## Activate Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should indicate the active virtual environment.

## Install Dependencies

Install project dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures that your project has all the necessary packages installed.

## Run Migrations

Apply database migrations to set up the initial database schema:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This command will create the necessary tables and structures defined in your Django project.

## Run Django Server

Start the Django development server with the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will start, and you can access your Django application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

Feel free to customize this README with additional information about your project, such as project structure, key features, or any other relevant details.
